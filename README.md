This crate contains a collection of filters and utilities for digital signal processing.

All types in this library are `no-std` (**zero allocation**) and so are suitable for use in embedded systems.

`Pt1Filter`, `Pt2Filter`, and `Pt3Filter` : basic first, second, and third order low-pass filters.

`BiquadFilter`: second order filter that can be used as a low-pass, high-pass, or notch filter.

## Motivation

They have been developed for use in stabilized vehicles (self balancing robots and aircraft)and have been used to:

1. Filter gyro and accelerometer output for use in the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).
2. Filter motor encoder values for use in the motor controller.
3. Filter derivative terms in a PID controller.
4. Filter motor power input values to smooth the motor speed.

## Original implementation

This crate was originally implemented as a c++ library.
